# Description
This package is intended to be used to perform jet reconstruction
starting from a DAOD with clusters.  It should be transparent, so that
a newcomer has examples and a good starting point for working on an
interesting topic. If this is not the case, please consider saying
something! 

The code is based on
[xAODAnaHelpers](https://github.com/UCATLAS/xAODAnaHelpers) with a
link to the example that this package is based on found
[here](https://github.com/UCATLAS/ASG_AnalysisFrameworkReview). 
xAODAnaHelpers is essentially a set of scripts and a few convenience
c++ classes based on the official EventLoop framework.

## Tutorial organisation

This tutorial shows how to run jet finding, grooming and calculating
substructure.
This task is done in 3 different ways giving identical results.

1. JSSTutorialAlgo implements the task using only C++ and calls to
fastjet. It is straightforward readable but rather monolithic.
2. JSSTutorialJetToolsAlgo implements the task using the Atlas JetRec
C++ classes. It shows how to configure these various classes and put
them together to perform the tasks. Most of the complexity is moved to
the initialization step, but then the execution code becomes much
simple :just a call to the 'excecute()' method of the top-level tools.
3. JSSTutorialPythonConfigAlgo implements the task using the same
Atlas JetRec classes as in 2, but configuring them entireley from
python scripts. This offers maximal flexibility and good readability
at the cost of abstraction and knowledge of the Atlas classes.

## basics on EventLoop and xAODAnaHelpers
In EventLoop, tasks are implemented in c++ classes inheriting
EL::Algorithm.

## Jet Reconstruction overview
In Atlas the jet reco code works in 3 distinct steps :
1. Prepare input to jet finding. This means translating the
 clusters/tracks/truth particles from the xAOD format to the fastjet
 format. 
2. Call fastjet using the input from 1. Translate final jets from
fastjet to xAOD::Jet.
3. Calculate additional quantities on final jets. Ex: calibration,
filtering, sorting, substructure quantities.

Each step are performed by dedicated dual-use tools (i.e tools which
run in Athena and RootCore).

1. PseudoJetGetter (and inherited)
2. JetFinder (or JetTrimmer in the trimming case)
3. Many tools, all inheriting IJetModifier : we call them
JetModifiers.

All these tools are driven by a top-level tool : JetRecTool. This last
tool runs the 3 steps and record the final JetContainer in the evt store.

Running a jet alg requires to configure tools for the 3 steps
and to associate them to a JetRecTool.

### Jet Reconstruction in this package
Here a jet building procedure is done by a JetRecToolAlgo (inherits
xAH::Algorithm which inherits EL::Algorithm).
JetRecToolAlgo holds a single instance of a JetRecTool and will call
it's execute() method once per event.

The configuration is done through python scripts : during
initialize(), JetRecToolAlgo will pass its JetRecTool instance into
the python interpreter under the name "tool". It will then execute
user given python script and function call. This script and function call
are then expected to configure "tool" as required.

In the simplest scenario, the user writes a python script (say
myjetscript.py) which sets the desired properties to "tool". ex :
```  
  tool.OutputContainer = "MyJetContainer"
  tool.JetFinder = JetFinder("AntiKt12", Radius=0.12, ... )
  tool.PseudoJetGetters = [ ... ] 
```  
The user then configures a JetRecToolAlgo to use myjetscript.py (by
setting its m_configScript member). Nothing else is needed.

However when running with several jet algs in the same job, it will be
painfull to maintain a version of myjetscript.py for each jet
alg. An other workflow is to define configuration functions in the
script and then configure JetRecToolAlgo to also call one of this
function. Ex :
```  
  def configMyJet(tool, R):
      # configure tool to run a jet alg with radius R
      tool.JetFinder = JetFinder("somname", Radius = R, ...)
      ... other configs ....
```  

Then all JetRecToolAlgo instance will use the same m_configScript, but
they can have different m_configCall to configure various jet
algs. Typically : m_configCall="configMyJet(tool, 0.9)"

## Jet reco example



## Quick Setup :

If you don't already have [kerberos](http://linux.web.cern.ch/linux/docs/kerberos-access.shtml) authentication set up, do that first -- this is important if you want to develop code from the copy of the code you check out:

```
kinit <username>@CERN.CH
```

To check out and set up the code, simply do:

```
git clone https://:@gitlab.cern.ch:8443/JetSubstructure/Tutorial_HCW2016.git
cd Tutorial_HCW2016/
source setup_tool.sh
```

note that the choice of the URL depends on the authentication method you are using.  Since we guided you to set up kerberos, it is the KRB5 url from the above dropdown menu.

## Get the test file :
```
setupATLAS
localSetupRucioClients
localSetupPandaClient
voms-proxy-init -voms atlas

rucio get --nrandom 1 mc15_13TeV.361024.Pythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23LO_jetjet_JZ4W.merge.DAOD_JETM8.e3668_s2576_s2132_r7267_r6282_p2528
```

## Tutorial 1 : Intro to native fastjet in ATLAS
Being familiar with fastjet and learning how to use it in your analysis is important, 
especially if you will be working in JetEtMiss (because your advisor said so)
or because you want to be more creative than the ATLAS tools will allow.  
Therefore, if you are not familiar with this set of tools please follow this tutorial.
To simply execute the tutorial (after successfully compiling and getting the test file), 
execute the following command :

```
xAH_run.py --files /afs/cern.ch/work/m/meehan/public/JSSTutorial2016/mc15_13TeV.361024.Pythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23LO_jetjet_JZ4W.merge.DAOD_JETM8.e3668_s2576_s2132_r7267_r6282_p2528/DAOD_JETM8* \
--nevents 1 \
--config config_Tutorial1_fastjet.py \
-v \
--submitDir OutputDirectory_Tutorial1_fastjet \
direct
```

note that you will have to point to the local file that you downloaded and not Sam's public directory.  Next, go 
ahead and read the source code and see if you can figure out how it works.

```
config_Tutorial1_fastjet.py
JSSTutorial/JSSTutorial/JSSTutorialAlgo.h
JSSTutorial/Root/JSSTutorialAlgo.cxx
```

Consider the following questions :
- How does the command know to execute the EventLoop algorithm in ```JSSTutorialAlgo.cxx```?
- What are the different components that I need to include in my header files and ```cmt/MakeFile.RootCore``` to allow me to have
access to fastjet?
- Where is jet finding done?  What if I only wanted to examine jets that have a minimum pT of 20 GeV when produced by fastjet?  How could I do that?
- What do I need to do in particular to get access to the fastjet contrib packages (https://fastjet.hepforge.org/contrib/)?  Can you identify an example 
of a fastjet contrib used here?  

## Tutorial 2 : Intro to JetRec in ATLAS
If you are already confident with using native fastjet then you've come to the right place.  The next step to being a jet expert is learning
how to use *JetRec* (http://acode-browser.usatlas.bnl.gov/lxr/source/atlas/Reconstruction/Jet/JetRec/).  This is the software that is used to perform
official ATLAS reconstruction, and once you come up with an amazing new idea, you will need to implement it here, if the functionality to execute it
does not already exist.

To get you started, this tutorial is intended to do *the exact same thing* as Tutorial 1, but using the official ATLAS tools.  Therefore, the task
here is to read the code in parallel with the last tutorial and find the similarities and differences.  But first, execute this tutorial
with the following command:

```
xAH_run.py --files /afs/cern.ch/work/m/meehan/public/JSSTutorial2016/mc15_13TeV.361024.Pythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23LO_jetjet_JZ4W.merge.DAOD_JETM8.e3668_s2576_s2132_r7267_r6282_p2528/DAOD_JETM8* \
--nevents 1 \
--config config_Tutorial2_JetRec.py \
-v \
--submitDir OutputDirectory_Tutorial2_JetRec \
direct
```

note that you will have to point to the local file that you downloaded and not Sam's public directory.  Next, go 
ahead and read the source code and see if you can figure out how it works.

```
config_Tutorial2_JetRec.py
JSSTutorial/JSSTutorial/JSSTutorialJetRecAlgo.h
JSSTutorial/Root/JSSTutorialJetRecAlgo.cxx
```

Consider the following questions :
- How did you "get the clusters" from the xAOD::CalCaloTopoCluster container this time?
- ...
