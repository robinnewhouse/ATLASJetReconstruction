# Description
This package is intended to be used to perform jet reconstruction starting from a DAOD with clusters.  It should be transparent so that a newcomer has examples and 
a good starting point for working on an interesting topic.  If this is not the case, please consider saying something.  The code is based on xAODAnaHelpers (https://github.com/UCATLAS/xAODAnaHelpers)
with a link to the example that this package is based on found here https://github.com/UCATLAS/ASG_AnalysisFrameworkReview


# Quick Setup :

If you don't already have kerberos authentication set up, do that first:

```
kinit username@CERN.CH
```

```
git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/JetSubstructure/Tutorial_HCW2016.git
cd Tutorial_HCW2016/
source setup_tool.sh
```

# Get the test file :
```
setupATLAS
localSetupRucioClients
localSetupPandaClient
voms-proxy-init -voms atlas

rucio get mc15_13TeV.301256.Pythia8EvtGen_A14NNPDF23LO_Wprime_WZqqqq_m800.merge.DAOD_JETM8.e3743_s2608_s2183_r7772_r7676_p2613
```

# Run locally
```
source Run_local.sh
```

# Run an example on the grid :
NOT TESTED

Open a fresh session, go to the working directory and setup the environment for the grid:
```
source grid_env.sh
```

Run an example on the grid by:
```
source Run_grid_zprime_list.sh
```
